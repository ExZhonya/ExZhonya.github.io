            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! it's me, Lua(or ExZhonya)
            most of you probably don't know me, and some of you probably do(i know i forced you to read this html)
            <br> but anyway, im here to tell you about my new-coming game, it's nothing that much interesting though! so anyway, let's hear it!</p>
            <h2>Game Mechanic</h2>
            <p>The game mechanic is going to be like that of text adventure, i doubt i will make a visual, like the character design or anything, just normal text and some tricks. it will contains monsters and dungeons, there will be like of stamina(probably not, not sure)</p>
            <h2>Fight Mechanic</h2>
            <p>The fight will not be a turn-based fight, instead it'll be like a cooldown each attack, different weapon, has different cooldowns. there'll be <br>
            [1]fist(default), [2]sword, <br>
            [3]spear, [4]gauntlet(fist upgrade?) </p>
            <h2>Map Mechanic</h2>
            <p>I will be making the map to have a control pad(?), up left right down arrows. the map will be probably categorized as zones for random dungeons etc, i think it shold reset every month/week ingame time.</p>
